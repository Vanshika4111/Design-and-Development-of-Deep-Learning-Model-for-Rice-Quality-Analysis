# Design-and-Development-of-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Rice-Quality-Analysis
This project focuses on the design and development of a deep learning model to analyze rice quality. The goal is to classify rice grains based on various quality metrics such as shape, size, and texture. The model leverages deep learning model architectures to provide accurate and reliable quality assessments, aiding in quality control processes in the rice production industry.


## Problem Statement
To classify rice grains based on their physical parameters for quality analysis
